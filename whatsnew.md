# 1.0 ðŸŽ‰

This is a major release with breaking changes.

It uses react-three-fiber's useLoader `node` and `material` look-up tables:

```jsx
const { nodes, materials, animations, scene } = useLoader(GLTFLoader, url)

return <mesh material={materials['base']} geometry={nodes['Cube.003_0'].geometry} />
```

The previous `__$` array does not work with three's new async DRACOLoader any longer because the indicies are now subject to race conditions. Named tables are cleaner, look better and are easier to use.

This means you must use gltfjsx with react-three-fiber => 4.0.12!

Other changes:

- GLTFLoader bugfixes (fixed some of the reported crashes).
- It references materials instead of spreading props, which was causing issues. This also means that materials are actually re-used, which wasn't the case before.
- Optional removal of empty nodes.
- Optional removal of named nodes.
- Turns Object3D's into Groups.
- Converts angles into fractions of PI.
- Floating point precision and shorter numbers.
- Formats the output using prettier.
- Demo example.
